Our accounting department is in absolute shambles. 

All the macros the accounting department uses were written by the now-fired nightmare known as Stacy. 

She replaced her arithmetic operations with strange functions in a strange language for snakes.

Her compare file accepts two arguments (a, b) which are compared. And a is evaluated against b.

We cannot access the budgets directly, so we just have to input the file keys.

Help us find out what her messages mean. We want whichever one means ~~greater than~~.
