We've been trying to figure out who on earth would subject the public to such torture.
Children should be protected, not exposed to this degree of horror and cringe.
Unfortunately, all communications we have intercepted are complete gibberish. 

Tony followed a suspected employee of the culprit production company for a few days.
When the guy went to the bathroom, Tony stole a sticky note with the following information written on it. 

  1: eoirghjfbsadk;nquwptcxvz13472085ml
  2: qazwsxdchjnkmlgpbfv;r3u4t20i,1968-5


All messages we have intercepted contain the string ~~rhqctcnlj~~ at the bottom.
Could this be the production company's signature???
